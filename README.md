## Voice Assist

This code is a simple voice command assistant built using Python's Tkinter for the GUI, and it integrates various functionalities such as fetching the current time and date, fetching news headlines, answering questions using Google search, playing music from YouTube, providing information from Wikipedia, and telling jokes.

Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. It imports necessary libraries such as Tkinter for GUI, gTTS for text-to-speech conversion, speech_recognition for recognizing speech input, and others for specific functionalities.

2. It defines functions for speaking text, getting the current time and date, listening to voice commands, and handling different types of commands.

3. The `handle_command()` function takes the recognized command text, interprets it, and performs the appropriate action based on the command.

4. The `start_listening()` function is triggered when the user clicks the "Start Listening" button. It listens for voice input and then handles the recognized command.

5. The GUI setup involves creating a window with buttons for starting listening and exiting the application.

6. The `window.mainloop()` statement runs the Tkinter event loop to keep the GUI window open and responsive.

To use this code, you need to have the required libraries installed (`tkinter`, `gtts`, `playsound`, `speech_recognition`, `requests`, `bs4`, `pywhatkit`, `wikipedia`, `pyjokes`, and `googletrans`). Additionally, you'll need to have a microphone connected to your system for voice input.

You may need to adjust paths to resources like the microphone icon (`microphone_icon.png`) if they're not in the same directory as your Python script.
